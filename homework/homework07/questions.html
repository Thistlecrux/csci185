    What corrections did you have to make, and how did you make them?
    I added alt text to all appearing images as well as a label for the search bar. I did this by adding alt text into the javascript and using "${}" to make each label custom to what shows up.

Is this interface functional without the use of a mouse (i.e., just using keyboard keys)? Why or why not?
    Maybe? I don't know if you can click using keyboard keys but I'm assuming you can.

What are other accessibility tests or features you added or would be interested in learning about?
    I'm not sure on anything in particular, but I would love to see how far accessability tools can go, as well as input from a disabled person of problems they run into that need to be fixed
