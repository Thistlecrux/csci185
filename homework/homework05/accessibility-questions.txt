Please answer the following accessibility questions:


1. What accessibility corrections did you have to make?
Adding the document language and alt text to all photos. There is an alert saying I have "empty buttons," but there was no instruction in the assignment to link them anywhere, so I'm assuming that's okay?

2. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?
Yes, but it may be slightly disorganized. The HTML itself is not terrible at all.

3. Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?
I'm not sure due to the fact that none of the links go anywhere yet.
