 <p>➼ No one under the age of 18 may commission. ID may be asked for at any time. If you are a minor interested in commissioning me, I will work through a parent, friend, or older sibling of legal age to create your character. Exceptions will be made for those 16 and over who can provide proof of income.
 </p>
 <p>
     ➼ I only take payments through Cashapp and Zelle. Paypal will ONLY be used for international customers, and the buyer must cover its transaction fee. Payment plans up to 3 months are accepted, but all payments must be complete before the suit is shipped.
 </p>
 <p>
     ➼ Shipping price is added on to the total of your suit at the end of completion. Within the US, shipping can range from $20 for parts to $300+ for a full suit, so keep this in mind when purchasing!
 </p>
 <p>
     ➼ I am not responsible for any items lost or damaged during shipping. Though, in the event of something happening, I insure all of my packages with their full worth to get money back if the package is lost.
 </p>
 <p>
     ➼ I do minor repairs for previous customers for free! You just have to pay for shipping.
 </p>
 <p>
     ➼ Once you are officially selected into my queue, a 10% downpayment is required to cover the materials of your suit. This payment is NON-REFUNDABLE. 
 </p>
 <p>
     ➼ Once your fursuit has been started, if  you back out of payments or purchase you will be blacklisted. Your item will be auctioned off and sold without alterations, and you will no longer be able to purchase from me in the future.
 </p>
 <p>
     ➼ Completion times can range from 1-6 months depending on the time of year and type of item commissioned. I am a full time student, and balance work and school! Remember, while punctual, fursuit makers are people too.
 </p>
 <p>
     ➼ We have cats and dogs that are members of the ThistleCrux home studio, so please consider allergens before commissioning or purchasing an item!
 </p>
 <p>
     ➼ I have a right to deny any commission for any reason. Please be respectful of my boundaries, keep requests tasteful.
